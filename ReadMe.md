This repository contains the code and report for Assignment 1 for the course *EPA133A Advance Simulation*. In this assignment we identified data quality issues and developed two algorithms to process Bangladesh's infrastructure data from World Bank: 

* one to fix road data quality issues
* one to fix bridge data quality issues
